    <h1>Jim Corbett National Park</h1>
    <p>
      Jim Corbett National Park is a national park in India located in the Nainital district of Uttarakhand state. The first national park in India, it was established in 1936 during the British Raj and named Hailey National Park after William Malcolm Hailey. In 1956, nearly a decade after India's independence, it was renamed after the hunter and naturalist Jim Corbett, who played a key role in its establishment.

      The park spans 520.8 kmÂ² and features hills, rivers, marshy areas, grasslands, and a large lake. It is home to a wide variety of flora and fauna including Bengal tigers, over 580 bird species, and 110 tree species. As part of the Project Tiger initiative, the park plays a vital role in tiger conservation.

      Located near Ramnagar and Kotdwar, the park offers eco-tourism opportunities, though increasing tourism remains a challenge to its ecological balance. It experiences cold winters and heavy monsoon rains from July to September. The forest is mainly composed of sal trees, with some areas covered by grasslands.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      The park area was once part of the princely state of Tehri Garhwal and came under British control in the 19th century. The land was first protected in 1868, then designated as a reserve forest in 1879. Efforts to create a national park began in the early 1900s and culminated in the creation of Hailey National Park in 1936. Since then, it has evolved into a vital sanctuary for Indiaâ€™s biodiversity.
