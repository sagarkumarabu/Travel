Hampi or Hampe (Kannada: [hɐmpe]), also referred to as the Group of Monuments at Hampi,<br>
 is a UNESCO World Heritage Site located in Hampi (City),<br>
  Ballari district now Vijayanagara district, east-central Karnataka,<br>
   India.[2] Hampi predates the Vijayanagara Empire;<br> 
   it is mentioned in the Ramayana and the Puranas of Hinduism as
    Pampa Devi Tirtha Kshetra.<br>[
   3][4] Hampi continues as a religious centre, with the Virupaksha Temple,<br>
    an active Adi Shankara-linked monastery and various monuments belonging
     to the old city.<br> 
 
 
Hampi was the capital of the Vijayanagara Empire from 1336 to 1565,
<br> when it was abandoned.[3] It was a fortified city.
 Chronicles left by Persian and European travellers,<br>
  particularly the Portuguese, say that Hampi was a prosperous, 
  <br>wealthy and grand city near the Tungabhadra River, with numerous 
  temples, farms and trading markets.<br> By 1500 CE, Hampi-Vijayanagara 
  was the world's second-largest city, after Beijing, <br>and probably 
  India's richest at that time, attracting traders from Persia and Portugal.
  <br>The Vijayanagara Empire was defeated by a coalition of Muslim sultanates;<br>
 its capital was conquered, pillaged and destroyed by Sultanate armies in 1565,
  after which Hampi remained in ruins.<br><br> 
Located in Karnataka near the small modern town of Hampi with the city of
 Hosapete 13 kilometres (8.1 mi) away, <br>
Hampi's ruins are spread over 4,100 hectares (16 sq mi) 
and it has been described by UNESCO as an "austere, grandiose site"
 of more than 1,600 surviving remains of the last great Hindu kingdom in 
 South India that includes "forts,
 riverside features, royal and sacred complexes, temples, shrines, pillared halls, 
 mandapas, memorial structures, water structures and others".

Etymology<br><br>
The name was derived from the old name of the Tungabhadra River which was Pampa,
 so the name Hampi is the English version of the Kannada name Hampe.

Location<br><br>

Hampi Vijayanagara in early 16th century.
 The sacred centre featured major Hindu temples
 and attached <br>markets; the urban core included the royal centre;
  suburban satellites were 
 spread from what is now Gangawati to Hosapete.</p>
