			Geography Mount Harriet National Park was originally a reserve forest which was converted into a national park in 1979. It encompasses an area of 4,662 hectares (11,520 acres), which is likely to be extended to cover an additional area of 1,700 hectares (4,200 acres)[8] to include adjoining mountain ranges and the marine ecosystem on the eastern coast. The mountains in the park are aligned in a north–south direction with the ridges and spurs originating from it aligned in an east–west direction. The park's elevation range is from zero at the coast to the peak level of 481 metres (1,578 ft).[8] The eastern face of the park has steep slopes, and the beaches here are also formed of rocks interspersed with small sandy areas. The park is drained by many streams which rise in the hills and flow into the sea on the east.[8] The park experiences marine climatic conditions,[2] and hot and humid conditions in view of its proximity to the equator.[8]
